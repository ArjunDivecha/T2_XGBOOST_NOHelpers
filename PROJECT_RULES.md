# Project Collaboration Rules

1.  **Modular Design for Verification:** The project will be developed in a modular way. Each significant step will produce a clear output (e.g., a data file, a plot, or a console report). This allows for step-by-step execution and verification of intermediate results before proceeding to the next step.

2.  **Plan and Approve Workflow:** For each step in the project, we will first discuss the plan, including the approach, inputs, outputs, and any key considerations. Code will only be written or suggested after the plan has been reviewed and approved. 
3. Clean up behind yourself. Delete unnecessary files and folders. when done with a step
4. At the end of each step update the Readme with instructions on what the next step needs to do, including file structures etc so thst it doesnt have to figure therm out from scratch
