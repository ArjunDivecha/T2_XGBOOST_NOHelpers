Based on my review of the PRD, README, and project files, I can outline how I would implement Step 10B. Looking at the README, I notice that Step 10A (Tune XGBoost Hyperparameters) has been completed, but there is no clear definition of what Step 10B should be. From examining the project structure and progression, and considering the PRD, I infer that Step 10B would likely focus on implementing a different modeling approach as an alternative to XGBoost.

## Implementation Plan for Step 10B - Alternative Modeling Approach

### 1. Purpose
Create an alternative modeling approach to complement the XGBoost implementation to provide comparison and potentially improved performance.

### 2. Proposed Implementation Steps

#### Setup and Configuration
1. **Create a configuration file for the alternative model** 
   - Define base parameters for the selected alternative model
   - Save configuration to `./output/S10B_Alt_Model_Config.json`

#### Model Selection
Based on the nature of the project (time series prediction with multiple factors), I recommend implementing:
- **LSTM Neural Network** - Good for capturing temporal dependencies in time series data
- OR
- **Random Forest Regressor** - A different ensemble method that might capture different patterns than XGBoost

#### Tuning Process
1. **Use the same random windows as Step 10A** for fair comparison
   - Load `S10A_Tuning_Windows.pkl` to ensure we evaluate on the same data
   
2. **Define parameter grid for the chosen alternative model**
   - For LSTM: units, layers, dropout rates, learning rates
   - For Random Forest: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, max_features

3. **Implement grid search or random search** over parameter space
   - Train on the same 60-month windows
   - Validate on the same 6-month windows
   - Use the same performance metrics for fair comparison

#### Evaluation and Comparison
1. **Compare performance between XGBoost and alternative model**
   - Calculate same metrics as Step 10A (MSE, MAE, R¬≤)
   - Test statistical significance of performance differences
   
2. **Visualize comparison results**
   - Create comparison charts between models
   - Analyze strengths/weaknesses of each approach

#### Output Files
1. **S10B_Alt_Model_Tuning_Results.xlsx**
   - Contains parameter combinations and performance metrics
   
2. **S10B_Alt_Model_Optimal_Params.json**
   - Optimal parameters after tuning
   
3. **S10B_Model_Comparison.xlsx**
   - Direct comparison between XGBoost and alternative model performance
   
4. **S10B_Tuning_Visualization.pdf**
   - Visual representation of tuning results and model comparison

### 3. Implementation Considerations
- Ensure the same evaluation methodology as XGBoost for fair comparison
- Focus on the same 20 randomly selected factors used in Step 10A
- Document model architecture decisions and rationales
- Implement early stopping to prevent overfitting
- Include time performance metrics (training/inference speed)

### 4. Next Steps After Implementation
- If alternative model shows promise, proceed to implement full training and prediction pipeline
- If XGBoost outperforms consistently, document findings and continue with XGBoost
- Consider ensemble approaches combining both models if they show complementary strengths

This implementation would provide a valuable alternative modeling approach while maintaining consistency with the existing project structure and evaluation methodology.

Thank you for providing the complete README. Now I have a much clearer understanding of what Step 10B should be. Based on the README, I would implement Step 10B as follows:

## Implementation Plan for Step 10B - Tune Linear Models

### 1. Overview
Step 10B involves tuning various linear regression models (OLS, Ridge, LASSO, NNLS) that were configured in Step 9B. The focus is on finding optimal regularization parameters and selecting the best performing linear model variant for each factor.

### 2. Implementation Steps

#### Data Preparation
1. **Load required input files**:
   - Load window schedule from `./output/S4_Window_Schedule.xlsx`
   - Load feature sets from `./output/S8_Feature_Sets.h5`
   - Load linear model configurations from `./output/S9B_Linear_Config.json`
   - Load tuning windows from `./output/S10A_Tuning_Windows.pkl` (for consistency with XGBoost)

#### Linear Model Tuning Framework
1. **Select tuning windows**:
   - Use the same 25 random windows as XGBoost for fair comparison
   - Select 20 random factors for tuning to manage computational load

2. **Define parameter grids for each linear model**:
   - OLS: No hyperparameters to tune
   - Ridge: `alpha` values [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0]
   - LASSO: `alpha` values [0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0]
   - NNLS: No hyperparameters to tune

3. **Implement cross-validation procedure**:
   - For each parameter combination, train on 60-month window
   - Validate on 6-month validation window
   - Calculate MSE, MAE, and R¬≤ on validation data
   - Track training and validation metrics for all models

#### Model Selection Logic
1. **Determine best model for each factor**:
   - Compare performance of OLS, Ridge, LASSO, and NNLS for each factor
   - Select the model with lowest validation MSE for each factor
   - Record parameter values for regularized models

2. **Analyze model selection patterns**:
   - Identify which model types are selected most frequently
   - Analyze which factors favor which model types

#### Output Generation
1. **Create comprehensive tuning results**:
   - `S10B_Linear_Tuning_Results.xlsx`: Detailed results of all parameter combinations
   - `S10B_Linear_Optimal_Params.json`: Selected model and parameters for each factor
   - `S10B_Linear_Model_Selection.xlsx`: Analysis of which model was selected for each factor

2. **Create visualizations**:
   - `S10B_Linear_Tuning_Visualization.pdf`: Performance charts comparing models
   - Include regularization path plots for Ridge and LASSO
   - Create bar charts showing model selection distribution

### 3. Key Considerations
1. **Regularization Focus**:
   - Primary focus on finding optimal alpha values for Ridge and LASSO
   - Test logarithmically spaced alpha values for comprehensive coverage
   - For each factor, determine if regularization improves performance

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Use MSE as primary metric for optimization
   - Track MAE and R¬≤ for comprehensive evaluation
   - Compare Ridge vs. LASSO performance for feature selection insights

3. **Computational Efficiency**:
   - Implement parallel processing where possible
   - Use scikit-learn's built-in cross-validation capabilities
   - Optimize memory usage for large datasets

4. **Documentation and Analysis**:
   - Document model selection logic thoroughly
   - Analyze regularization patterns across factors
   - Identify which factors benefit most from which model types

This implementation will provide a comprehensive tuning of linear models as an alternative to the XGBoost approach in Fork A, following the same rigorous evaluation methodology to ensure fair comparison.
